Code and experiments to construct surfaces from point clouds and render them, as part of a hackathon.

algos - contains code to convert formats, and has a few algorithms to sparsify point clouds and construct surfaces from them. Also has some code to render point clouds in Blender.

test3 - Unity application that renders point clouds by sparsifying them and constructing solid surfaces, and allows the user to move around.
